I'm happy to refer my friend Shally Suman Munda for this opportunity. She's someone who naturally combines curiosity with strong problem-solving skills. At Porter, she led key customer and partner behavior research, improved UI flows with A/B testing, and worked closely with cross-functional teams to drive real operational results like a 25% increase in fulfillment rates. She’s also led a 100+ member team as Marketing Director at 180 Degrees Consulting BIT Mesra, and built projects using SQL, Power BI, and Excel. I’ve seen her bring structure to chaos and genuinely care about impact, she’d be a great addition to any team!
